# Things we've learned
1. Using Git and Github with a team
2. Taking input from user to move the spaceship
3. Using OOP for objects like the alien to build an alien wall



Our initial goal was to replicate the Space Invader game by incorporating our own graphics. We tried to implement various elements from our previous homeworks and labs - particularly Bubble Blitz, Breakout Game & Critters. However, in addition to the basic game functions, we added a few additional functionalities: we made the alienwall move down diagonally across the screen and we added a testing file (which was not a part of our initial plan). 

Our code is fairly straightforward. You can open the SpaceInvaderz folder on Visual Studio Code, and open the SpaceInvaderz java file and run the code. That should start the game and allow you to play. If you would like to test for the game, you can also open the Test folder and run the SpaceInvaderzTest file. 

The most challenging part of the project was honestly Github at first - since we all worked on the code simaltaenously, we ran into some trouble where we could not retrieve the changes made by each member. However, once figuring that out, some of the technical challenges were creating the Health Bar, making the AlienWall move diagonally, and making the aliens shoot bullets.
